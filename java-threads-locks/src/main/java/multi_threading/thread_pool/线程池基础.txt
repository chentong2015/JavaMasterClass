TODO: 线程池中线程的五种状态
RUNNING:  Accept new tasks and process queued tasks
SHUTDOWN: Don't accept new tasks, but process queued tasks
STOP:     Don't accept new tasks, don't process queued tasks, and interrupt in-progress tasks
TIDYING:  All tasks have terminated, workerCount is zero, the thread transitioning to state TIDYING
          will run the terminated() hook method
TERMINATED: terminated() has completed

TODO. 企业级使用线程池策略: 针对任务的类型来调配
1. CPU密集型(读取视频)，不建议设置过多的线程数
2. IO密集型(文件读取)，对CPU要求不高，对磁盘和内存要求高，则多设置线程数量
