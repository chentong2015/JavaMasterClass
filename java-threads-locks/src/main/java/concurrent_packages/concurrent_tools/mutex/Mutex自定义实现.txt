A mutex is the simplest type of synchronizer
– It ensures that only one thread can execute the critical section of a computer program at a time.
- A thread acquires the mutex, then accesses the critical section, and finally releases the mutex.
  In the meantime, all other threads block till the mutex releases.
- As soon as a thread exits the critical section, another thread can enter the critical section.

Mutex本质是一种同步器，能够保证只有一个线程修改临界区数据
Mutex的实现方式并不唯一，可以通过synchronized，ReentrantLock，Semaphore..
