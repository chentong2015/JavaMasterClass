How to replace line breaks in Java ?

The sequence \r\n represents a single (Windows) line terminator,
so we need to be careful not to replace it with two spaces. !!

// #1
text = text.replace("\n", "");
Simply removes all the newline characters.
This does not cope with Windows or Mac line terminations.

// #2
text = text.replace(System.getProperty("line.separator"), "");
Removes all line terminators for the current platform.
This does not cope with the case where you are trying to process a UNIX file on Windows, or vice versa.

// #3
text = text.replaceAll("\\r|\\n", "");
Removes all Windows, UNIX or Mac line terminators.
However, if the input file is text, this will concatenate words;

// #4 这个版本是最全解
text = text.replaceAll("\\r\\n|\\r|\\n", " ");

// #5 这个版本是最优解
which replaces each line terminator with a space1. Since Java 8 you can also do this:
text = text.replaceAll("\\R", " ");

// #6
And if you want to replace multiple line terminator with one space:
text = text.replaceAll("\\R+", " ");
