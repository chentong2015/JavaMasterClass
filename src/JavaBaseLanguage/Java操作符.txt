TODO. Java Operators 操作符全集: 判断优先级以及方向
1. Java Operator Precedence Table 操作符的优先级
2. Associativity: Left to right, Right to left 运算方向

Simple Assignment Operator
=       Simple assignment operator
Arithmetic Operators
+       Additive operator (also used for String concatenation 用在字符串的级联)
-       Subtraction operator

Multiplication operator
/       Division operator
%       Remainder operator

Unary Operators
+       Unary plus operator; indicates

positive value (numbers are positive without this, however)
-       Unary minus operator; negates an expression
++      Increment operator; increments a value by 1
--      Decrement operator; decrements a value by 1
!       Logical complement operator; inverts the value of a boolean

Equality and Relational Operators
==      Equal to
!=      Not equal to
>       Greater than 作用在primitive types类型上面，直接比较
>=      Greater than or equal to
<       Less than
<=      Less than or equal to Conditional Operators
&&      Conditional-AND
||      Conditional-OR
?:      Ternary (shorthand for if-then-else statement)

Type Comparison Operator
instanceof      Compares an object to a specified type

Bitwise and Bit Shift Operators
~       Unary bitwise complement
<<      Signed left shift
>>      Signed right shift
>>>     Unsigned right shift
&       Bitwise AND
^       Bitwise exclusive OR
|       Bitwise inclusive OR
::      Method reference (> Java 8) 方法引用操作符, 将方法作为参数传递
